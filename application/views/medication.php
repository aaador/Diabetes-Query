<b>Insulin</b> <br/>
Diabetes insulin treatment is essential for people with type 1, although people with type 2 can also use insulin. Find out the latest diabetes insulin information. <br/>
How to Inject Insulin?<br/>
Insulin is measured in "units." A new bottle of U-100 insulin, the most commonly used strength of insulin in the United States, holds 1,000 units. New insulin cartridges or prefilled pens have 300 units each, so boxes of five cartridges or prefilled pens have a total of 1,500 units. Unopened insulin should be refrigerated. Once opened, insulin may be kept at room temperature for 30 days. After 30 days it should be thrown away.<br/>
Many types of insulin are available. Your doctor will decide the best type, amount, and administration time(s) for you. If you are going to use a syringe and vial, follow the directions below. Although injecting insulin might feel awkward at first, with a little practice you'll find it takes only a few seconds.<br/><br/>



<b>Other Injectables:</b> <br/>
Think diabetes injections are limited to insulin? Think again. Learn about other injectable medications that help manage diabetes, including exenatide (Byetta). <br/>
The Benefits of an Insulin Pen: <br/>
The sleek design and compact size of insulin pens allow accurate, simplified, convenient insulin delivery. Several, but not all, insulin types are available. Your doctor will determine the best option for you.
Pens most often come prefilled and are disposable when empty. A few models may require you to load an insulin cartridge. Multiple doses are possible with each pen or cartridge holding 300 units, packaged five per box for a total of 1,500 units. Possible single-dose amounts range from 1/2 unit up to 80 units, depending on the pen. New, unopened insulin should be refrigerated. Once in use, keep at room temperature, below 86 degrees F. Use according to package insert (10-42 days), specific to insulin type.
If required, load insulin cartridge into pen device. Prior to first-time use, seek instruction from a diabetes educator or pharmacist. <br/> <br/>

How to Avoid Diabetes Complications? <br/>
    Diabetes Complications: Less Common Today <br/>

Having diabetes puts a person at greater risk for heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, loss of limbs, and other unwanted complications.
    Fortunately, most diabetes complications can be limited or effectively treated with early detection and proper care as soon as you or your health care provider discovers the complication, says Richard Jackson, M.D., of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Keeping blood glucose (or blood sugar), blood pressure, and blood lipids (such as cholesterol) on target is also important in preventing and treating complications.
    Despite what you may hear, Jackson says, diabetes itself is not a leading cause of blindness or heart disease in the United States. Rather, poorly managed diabetes is a leading cause of these and other serious health problems.
    The Good News: "People with diabetes are living longer and healthier lives than ever," Jackson says. "All of the complications are becoming less common due to all the new tools we have for treatment."
    You play an important role in prevention and have the ability to live well with diabetes.

How to Give Yourself a Diabetic Foot Exam? <br/>
Check your feet weekly if you've never had complications. Perform exams daily if you have lost sensation and/or a history of foot wounds. <br/>
Limited flexibility and belly flab can make foot exams difficult to do on your own. But you're not off the hook! Allow a companion or caretaker to help.  <br/><br/>



<b>Pain Management</b><br/>
Diabetes pain management is vital to living well. Learn how to take the "ouch" out of diabetes and get information on diabetes and pain medications. <br/>
Pain from Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: <br/>
An estimated 60-70 percent of people with diabetes have some form of neuropathy, making it one of the most common complications of diabetes. The symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)ónerve damage in the extremitiesóare most often felt in the toes, feet, and hands.
Common descriptions of the feelings or sensations for DPN are:<br>

1. Burning<br>

2. Numbness<br>

3. Tingling<br>

4. Stinging<br>

5. Electrical vibrations<br>

6. Shooting pain<br>

7. Searing pain<br><br>

<p>
People experience the nerve damage from DPN in different ways. For example, a person can lose feeling without pain or have pain without numbness or have no pain at all. The most common symptoms are burning and numbness, which can be key for diagnosis. <br/>
"It's usually a loss of feeling, and then a burning sensation where that feeling's been lost," says Robert Gerwin, M.D., pain management specialist and associate professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. "It's not the dull, sore muscle and joint aches and pains that you may feel from aging," he says. And when these symptoms aren't given the attention they deserve, they're likely to progress. <br/>
Read on to learn why pain occurs, along with descriptions of commonly prescribed medications; topical analgesics, such as capsaicin and lidocaine; and treatments for pain that complement other therapies, such as acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). <br/>
Talk with your doctor about the following options, and decide together what methods of pain relief will help you live more comfortably.
